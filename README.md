# React Carousel

The aim of this project is to practice useState for storing and updating state.

This carousel will allow us to click the backward or forward buttons to go to the previous or next image.

The images are be stored in a simple array. We will see how to use state in order to store the current image. Then we will update that state to go to the previous or next image, according to the button the user pressed.

If the user has gone through all of the images, you will figure out how to start at the beginning of the array, to allow them to cycle through the images again.
